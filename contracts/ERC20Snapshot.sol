     * First, it can be used to increase the cost of retrieval of values from snapshots, although it will grow
     * logarithmically thus rendering this attack ineffective in the long term. Second, it can be used to target
     * specific accounts and increase the cost of ERC20 transfers for them, in the ways specified in the Gas Costs
